   In lake stevens school district, their food is all junk food like Burgers, nachos, pizza  or chicken nuggets. My opinion is for the school distract to give more healthier
food. The school says that they are trying to keep us safe but with this junk  food  it  is  not good for us.
    

The school should give food like lettuce, salad, cucumber or health sandwichs. Students have a limit to  how much  junk food they should eat but if they go past the limit they could get sick or even worse. The school should not take away junk food but they can give it  every alternative week so junk food and health food can be balanced. And students can  work on their class work more better.
